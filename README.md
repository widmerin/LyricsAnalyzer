## Idea
Analyse the words used in chartsongs.
Which words are used the most, in what year...
Are words like 'facebook' and so on since the rise of social media present in chartsongs?
## Datasources
Chartsongs of the last 20 years are gathered from swiss charts website https://hitparade.ch/charts/singles . The lyrics were collected over the API lyrics.ovh. 
 
There is no API provided for the swiss charts data, so we used webcrawling. The crawler called for each required chartsdate the hitparade.ch website for the specific date  
Example: https://hitparade.ch/charts/singles/16-09-2018

The crawler got the artist and songtitle information from links with the css class `navb`   
For all collected charts songs the lyrics were collected over the API https://api.lyrics.ovh
### Parameters  
Time range: from 4.10.1998 to 7.10.2018  
Time slot: every three months (every 84 days)
