# Lyrics Analyzer
## Idea
Analyse the words used in chartsongs.
Which words are used the most, in what year...
Are words like 'facebook' and so on since the rise of social media present in chartsongs?

## Datasource
Chartsongs of the last 20 years are gathered from swiss charts website. There is no API provided, so we used webcrawling.
