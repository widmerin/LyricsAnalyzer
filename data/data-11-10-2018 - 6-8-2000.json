Alles andere hab ich gerne zugesch\u00fcttet,  und mit sch\u00f6nen Erinnerungen \u00fcberbr\u00fcckt.   Glaub mir Bruder, ich schau nicht mehr zur\u00fcck.    [1. Verse]  Kool Savas:  Heut ist ein neuer Beginn,   ein neuer Anfang, ein neuer Start,  ein neues Kapitel, ein neuer Schritt in ne neue Richtung, ein neuer Tag.   Und ich lass den Balast von gestern hinter mir,   \u00f6ffne meine Augen, versuche meine Ziele zu fokussiern,  sie halten mich nicht auf, kriegen mich nicht weg,   versuchen mich zu hassen, aber lieben diese Tracks.  Ich pack mein Herzblut in das hier, z\u00fcnd eine Kerze an, vergiss die Schmerzen f\u00fcr einen Moment und du denkst du k\u00f6nntest fliegen, wenn ich rap.  Ich ging durch Tiefen und durch H\u00f6hen, aber immer weiter.  Ich blick zur\u00fcck, es war nicht immer einfach, doch jetzt kann ich nimmer scheitern.  Rap is my Life und jeder Verse ein Satz im Tagebuch,  jede dieser Melodien Heilung pur, du sparst dir nen Arztbesuch.  Tod gewordener Wagemut,  Tonnen von Bars, bis jeder sagt: \"wir haben genug!\".   Silben, Worte, lass sie flowen, wie Nasenblut.  Ich mach mein Ding auch wenn sie glauben ich w\u00e4r verr\u00fcckt.  King Essah, Futurama ...    [Hook]  Xavier Naidoo:  Und ich schau nicht mehr zur\u00fcck,   aber wenn ich zur\u00fcck schau, seh ich nur mein Gl\u00fcck.

[Bridge]  Xavier Naidoo:  Niemand kann seine Schritte teilen,   und sie einem andern geben.  Man muss nicht \u00fcberall bleiben,  man muss nicht immer gehn.  Mann kann nicht vor sich selber fl\u00fcchten,   man kann nur f\u00fcr sich selber stehn.  Und sollte sich vor gar nix f\u00fcrchten,  es gibt keinen Grund nicht nach vorne zu sehn.    [2. Verse]  Kool Savas:  Ich dreh mich nochmal um, mein letzter Blick ist vorbei,  salutier der Vergangenheit, lass nicht zu, dass der Zweifel mich noch geistet.  Meine Entscheidung frei sein oder mich fallen lassen,  h\u00f6r nicht hin, wenn sie meinen du musst dir vom Schicksal alles gefallen lassen.  Niemals, erheben Veto,  lieber m\u00fchsam als leblos,   auch wenn es wehtut,  bezweing jede noch so rei\u00dfende Str\u00f6mung.  Ich seh hoch, gleich was sie sagen, wers lenkt, leitet und dr\u00fcckt.  Mein Leben, meine Bestimmung...     [Hook 2x]  Xavier Naidoo:  Und ich schau nicht mehr zur\u00fcck,   aber wenn ich zur\u00fcck schau, seh ich nur mein Gl\u00fcck.

Where the thunder turns around they'll run so hard   we'll tear the ground away.    You know no one dies, in these love town lies,  Through our love drowned eyes,   we'll watch you sleep tonight.    Although no one understood we were holding back the flood,  Learning how to dance the rain.  We were holding back the flood   they said we'd never dance again.    Bleeding, but none of us leaving,  Watch your mouth son   or you'll find yourself floating home.  Here we come now on a dark star,   seeing demons, not what we are.  Tiny minds and eager hands hands   will try to strike but now will end today.    There's progress now where there once was none,   where there once was ah, then everything came along.    Although no one understood, we were holding back the flood   learning how to dance the rain.  There was more of them than us now they'll never dance again.

He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn't mind, he doesn't want the company. But there's something in the air  They share a look in silence and everything is understood.  Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand  as the rain puts a tear in his eye.    She says:    Don't let go! Never give up - it's such a wonderful life.  Don't let go! Never give up - it's such a wonderful life.    Driving through the city to the temple station,  Cries into the leather sea,  And Susie knows the baby was a familiy man,  But the world has got him down on his knees.    So she throws him at the wall and kisses burn like fire,  And suddenly he starts to believe,  He takes her in his arms he doesn't know why,  But it seems that he begins to see  She says    Don't let go!

When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  Born to a throne, stronger than Rome But violent prone, poor people zone, But it's my home, all I have known, Where I got grown, streets we would roam. Out of the darkness, I came the farthest, Among the hardest survival. Learn from these streets, it can be bleak, Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat.  So we struggling, fighting to eat and We wondering when we'll be free, So we patiently wait, for that fateful day, It's not far away, so for now we say  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  So many wars, settling scores, Bringing us promises, leaving us poor, I heard them say, love is the way, Love is the answer, that's what they say, But look how they treat us, make us believers, We fight their battles, then they deceive us, Try to control us, they couldn't hold us, 'Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers.  But we struggling, fighting to eat, And we wondering, when we'll be free So we patiently wait, for that fateful day, It's not far away, but for now we say,  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  (Oh Oh Oh Oh) And everybody will be singing it (Oh Oh Oh Oh) And you and I will be singing it (Oh Oh Oh Oh) And we all will be singing it (Oh Oh Oh Oh)  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  When I get older, I will be stronger, They'll call me freedom, just like a wavin' flag, And then it goes back, and then it goes back, And then it goes back  When I get older, when I get older I will be stronger, just like a wavin' flag, Just like a wavin' flag, just like a wavin' flag Flag, flag, just like a wavin' flag"},

I'd like to make myself believe  That planet Earth turns slowly.    It's hard to say that I'd  Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,  Cause everything is never as it seems.    Cause I'd get a thousand hugs  From ten thousand lightening bugs  As they tried to teach me how to dance.    A foxtrot above my head,  A sock-hop beneath my bed,  The disco ball is just hanging by a thread.    I'd like to make myself believe  That planet Earth turns slowly.  It's hard to say that I'd  Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,  Cause everything is never as it seems.  (When I fall asleep.)    Leave my door open just a crack.  (Please take me away from here.)  Cause I feel like such an insomniac.  (Please take me away from here.)    Why do I tire of counting sheep?  (Please take me away from here.)  When I'm far too tired to fall asleep    To ten million fireflies.  I'm weird, cause I hate goodbyes  I got misty eyes as they said farewell    But I'll know where several are  If my dreams get real bizarre  Cause I saved a few,  And I keep them in a jar.    I'd like to make myself believe  That planet Earth turns slowly.  It's hard to say that I'd  Rather stay awake when I'm asleep,  Cause everything is never as it seems.  (When I fall asleep.)    I'd like to make myself believe  That planet Earth turns slowly.  It's hard to say that I'd  Rather stay awake when I'm asleep  Because my dreams are bursting at the seams    (Thanks to Dylan for these lyrics)"},

Seeing your face no more on my pillow  Is a scene that's never ever happened to me.    (Do you know?)    But after this episode I don't see  You could never tell the next thing life could be    Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?  Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?    Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?  Do you know, do you know, do you know, do ya?  Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?    (Do you know?)  (Do you know?)  (Do you know?)  (Do you know?)

Do you know what it feels like to be the last one to know the lock on the door has changed?    Do you know what it feels like loving someone that's in a rush to throw you away?

Tom-boy running around, hanging with all the guys.  Or a little tough boy with beautiful brown eyes?  I payed for the murder before they determined the sex  Choosing our life over your life meant your death  And you never got a chance to even open your eyes  Sometimes I wonder as a fetus if you faught for your life?  Would you have been a little genius in love with math?  Would you have played in your schoolclothes and made me mad?  Would you have been a little rapper like your papa da Piper?  Would you have made me quit smokin' by finding one of my lighters?  I wonder about your skintone and shape of your nose?  And the way you would have laughed and talked fast or slow?  Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen  Happy birthday, love you whoever you woulda been  Happy birthday...

[Verse 2:]  I've got a millon excuses to why you died  Bet the people got their own reasons for homicide  Who's to say it woulda worked, and who's to say it wouldn't have?  I was young and strugglin' but old enough to be your dad  The fear of being a father has never disappeared  Pondering frequently while I'm zippin' on my beer  My vision of a family was artificial and fake  So when it came time to create I made a mistake  Now you've got a little brother maybe he's really you?  Maybe you really forgave us knowin' we was confused?  Maybe everytime that he smiles it's you proudly knowin'  that your father's doin' the right thing now?  I never tell a woman what to do with her body  But if she don't love children then we can't party  Think about it every year, so I picked up a pen  Happy birthday, love you whoever you woulda been  Happy birthday...

I can't find mommy, where is she?\"  \"I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy  Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself\"  I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself  Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her  And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her  That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy  Shady made me  But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby    And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,  Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,  I'm lookin' down on you smilin'  And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back    And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,  Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,  I'm lookin' down on you smilin'  And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back    I keep havin' this dream,  I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing  \"You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'\"  \"Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin'  You always say that, you always say this is the last time  But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine\"  She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it  \"Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it\"  Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket  It's got a picture, \"This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya\"  I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror  These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em  They're sayin', \"you got one more chance to do right  And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late\"  And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door  It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'    And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,  Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,  I'm lookin' down on you smilin'  And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back    And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,  Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,  I'm lookin' down on you smilin'  And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back    Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat  The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet  I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out  They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd  I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'  \"Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'\"  But baby we're in Sweden  How did you get to Sweden?  \"I followed you daddy  You told me that you weren't leavin'  You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad  And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad  That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin\"  \"I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'\"  \"But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice  Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us  That's what they want  They want you, Marshall  They keep screamin' your name  It's no wonder you can't go to sleep  Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will!  You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real\"  I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see  How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me  I turn around, find a gun on the ground  Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it  The sky darkens, my life flashes  The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes  That's when I wake up  Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin'  It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'  I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her  Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say    And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,  Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,  I'm lookin' down on you smilin'  And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back    And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn,  Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that,  I'm lookin' down on you smilin'  And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back"},

Schaff' ein kleines bisschen Klarheit.  Und schau wie sich der Schleier hebt.  Eine W\u00fcste aus Beton und Asphalt,  Doch, sie lebt und \u00f6ffnet einen Spalt.

So wie die Nacht \u00fcber die Welt.  Schnellt Gefahr aus der Dunkelheit,  Bin ich zum ersten Schlag bereit.  Ich bin der erste, der dich befreit.  Und einer der letzten, der um dich weint.

It's a different ball game  You call names and you ain't just rappin'  We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'  Me and Dre had sat with him  Kicked it and had a chat with him  And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him    Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him  Fuck it, \"50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it!\"  Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction  Some receptionist at the Source  Who answers phones at his desk    Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection  Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record  But now he's fucked the game up, \u0091cause one of the ways I came up,   Was through that publication  The same one that made me famous    Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?  Well, fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then!  But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think  That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc    And he's inherited mine, which is fine  Ain't like either of us mind  We still have soldiers that's on the front line  That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders  Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us    And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus  To show 'em we love 'em back  And let them know how important it is  To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners  Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is    But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered  It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it  Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict  I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further    But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'  I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'  Off at your jaws, well, then I can  \u0091Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'.   I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, \u0091cause\u0085    Step by step, heart to heart  Left, right, left we all fall down   Like toy soldiers  Bit by bit, torn apart   We never win but the battle wages on   For toy soldiers"},

From standing on corners and porches just rapping  To having a fortune, no more kissing ass  But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you  Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you  To get they hands on every dime you have  They want you to lose your mind every time you mad  So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon  Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns  That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me  Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly  But all their kids been listening to me religiously  So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me  They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me  If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B  It's all political, if my music is literal  Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?  I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to  You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you    Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)  Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!)  Sing it with me, just for today  Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away    They say music can alter moods and talk to you  Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?  Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude  Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued  See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols  And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool  Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves  We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales  You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self  We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail  It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing  To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted  That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing  Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine  Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long  Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs  Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives  So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die  'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe  We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes  That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it  Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden  And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone  Just let our spirits live on  Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can    Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)  Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)  Sing it with me, just for today  Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it)  Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)

No special effects  Yank the chain off of your neck, demand the respect  Now all your conversations sound strange to me  It be like everybody around me done changed but me  I stand alone on my own two feet  Stab a track, strangle the beat - Restless, no time for sleep  Niggas be weak, I'm concrete like Benjamin Grimm  It's a very thin line between a foe and a friend  Straight to the chin (Not these niggas again)  Call Doc, bounce to the spot, and slide right in  I ain't tryin to see nothing but progress, regardless  Home of the heartless, move right, remain cautious  Represent nothing but the hustle and struggle  Hennessy, rock plenty of ice, making a double, now SCREAM    Repeat 1 (2x)    [Snoop Dogg]  So there you have it; A-B-C, D-P-G-C  X to the motherfuckin Z  Mr. Xuberant, Xtravagant, Xtrordinary, Xciting, X-a-lotta  X-O with a little bit of Xtasy  X-ing your bitch-ass out if you tryin to test the G  And what's the recipe?

Man how's your daughter?  My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father  If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?  I'ma name her Bonnie    I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry  I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him  I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan  I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam  I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man  I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was fat  Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,  just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan  This is Stan    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why   I got out of bed at all  The morning rain clouds up my window  and I can't see at all  And even if I could it'll all be gray,  but your picture on my wall  It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad    Dear Slim,   you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance  I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans  If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert  you didn't have to,   but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew  That's my little brother man,   he's only six years old  We waited in the blistering cold for you four hours   and you just said, \"No.\"  That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol  He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do    I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to  Remember when we met in Denver?  You said if I'd write you, you would write back  See, I'm just like you in a way; I never knew my father neither  He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her  I can relate to what you're saying in your songs  So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on  \u0091Cause I don't really got shit else  So that shit helps when I'm depressed  I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest    Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds  It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me  See everything you say is real  And I respect you \u0091cause you tell it  My girlfriend's jealous \u0091cause I talk about you 24/7  But she don't know you like I know you, Slim,   no one does  She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up  You gotta call me, man  I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan  P.S. We should be together too    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why   I got out of bed at all  The morning rain clouds up my window  and I can't see at all  And even if I could it'll all be gray,  but your picture on my wall  It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad    Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans  This'll be the last package I ever send your ass  It's been six months and still no word \u0096 I don't deserve it?  I know you got my last two letters  I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect  So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it  I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway    Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?  You know the song by Phil Collins \"In the Air of the Night\"   about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin'  But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?  That's kinda how this is  You could've rescued me from drowning  Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy    And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call  I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall  I loved you, Slim, we could've been together \u0096 think about it!  You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it  And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it  I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me  See, Slim--shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk  Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk  But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you  \u0091Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more  And then she'll die too  Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now  Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?    My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why   I got out of bed at all  The morning rain clouds up my window  and I can't see at all  And even if I could it'll all be gray,  but your picture on my wall  It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad    Dear, Stan,   I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy  You said your girlfriend's pregnant now. How far along is she?  Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that  And here's an autograph for your brother  I wrote it on a Starter cap  I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you  Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you  But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?   I say that shit just clowning, dawg  Come on, how fucked up is you?    You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'  To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls  When you get down some  And what's this shit about us meant to be together?  That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other  I really think you and your girlfriend need each other  Or maybe you just need to treat her better  I hope you get to read this letter  I just hope it reaches you in time  Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine  If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you  But Stan, why are you so mad?  Try to understand that I do want you as a fan    I just don't want you to do some crazy shit;   I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick  Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge  And had his girlfriend in the trunk  And she was pregnant with his kid  And in the car they found a tape  But they didn't say who it was to  Come to think about it, his name was  it was you, damn!"},

You're always there. You are my shoulder to cry on. I can't believe it took me quite so long.  To take the forbidden step.  Is this something that I might regret?    (Come on, come on)  Nothing ventured nothing gained.  (You are the one)  A lonely heart that can't be tamed.  (Come on, come on)  I'm hoping that you feel the same.  This is something that I can't forget.    I thought that we would just be friends.  Things will never be the same again.  It's just the beginning it's not the end.  Things will never be the same again.  It's not a secret anymore.  Now we've opened up the door.  Starting tonight and from now on.  We'll never, never be the same again.  Never be the same again.    Now I know that we were close before.  I'm glad I realised I need you so much more.  And I don't care what everyone will say.  It's about you and me.  And we'll never be the same again.    I thought that we would just be friends (oh yeah).  Things will never be the same again. (Never be the same again)  It's just the beginning it's not the end. (We've only just begun)  Things will never be the same again.  It's not a secret anymore.  Now we've opened up the door. (Opened up the door)  Starting tonight and from now on.  We'll never, never be the same again.  Never be the same again.    Nite and day.  Black beach sand to red clay.  The US to UK, NYC to LA.  From sidewalks to highways.  See it'll never be the same again.  What I'm sayin'  My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged.    But sometimes it seems completely forbidden.  To discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden.  Where there's no competition.  And you render my condition.  Though improbable it's not impossible.  For a love that could be unstoppable.    But wait.  A fine line's between fate and destiny.  Do you believe in the things that were just meant to be?  When you tell me the stories of your quest for me.  Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly.    And as our energies mix and begin to multiply.  Everyday situations, they start to simplify.  So things will never be the same between you and I.  We intertwined our life forces and now we're unified.    I thought that we would just be friends.  Things will never be the same again.  It's just the beginning it's not the end.  Things will never be the same again.  It's not a secret anymore.  Now we've opened up the door.  Starting tonight and from now on.  We'll never, never be the same again.    (Come on, come on)  Things will never be the same again.  (You are the one)  Never be the same again.  It's not a secret anymore.  We'll never be the same again.  It's not a secret anymore.  We'll never be the same again.  Never be the same again.  Never be the same again.  Never be the same again.  Never be the same again."},
